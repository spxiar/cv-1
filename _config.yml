  Hey there, Im Spiros, an ICT Engineer graduate from the Department of Informatics at the Ionian University.
  
  My interests include, but are not limited to, gaining experience in the following areas:
  - Networking (Cisco, Mikrotik, Ubiquiti)
  - Server Infrastructures
  - Web Development (Angular, React)
  - Virtualization Management (Proxmox)
  - Docker Containers
  
  Technical skills are not the only area I have developed through my expirience. My peers describe me as a valuable team member, who knows how to work under strict deadlines and provide quality results.
