  Hey there, Iâ€™m Spyros and I am a senior student in the Department of Informatics of the Ionian University.
  
  I am interested but not limited to gain experience in the following areas:
  - Mobile development (iOS only)
  - Web development (e.g. React or Angular)
  - End-to-end testing suites (e.g. puppeteer)
  - Networking (Firewalling, SDWAN)
  - E-shop Frameworks (e.g. WooCommerce or Magento)
  
 Because just technical skills are good enough to work with computers, to work with people I have developed team working skills and I am considered from my peers as a strong analytical thinker.
