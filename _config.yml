about_content: | 
  Hey there, Iâ€™m Spiros and I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Informatics of the Ionian University.
  
  My interests include, but are not limited to, gaining experience in the following areas:
  - Networking (Firewalling, SDWAN)
  - Web development (e.g. React or Angular)
  - E-shop Frameworks (e.g. WooCommerce or Magento)
  - Mobile development (iOS only)
  - End-to-end testing suites (e.g. puppeteer)
  
  Technical skills are not the only area I have developed through my expirience. My peers describe me as a valuable team member, who knows how to work under strict deadlines and provide quality results.
