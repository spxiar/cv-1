  Hey there, Im Spiros, a Systems Administrator and a graduate from the Department of Informatics at the Ionian University.
  
  After building a solid foundation in Networking (Cisco, MikroTik, Ubiquiti) and Systems Administration (Windows/Linux/MacOS), I am deepening my expertise in modern DevOps and automation practices.
   
  Currently, I'm actively working with and further exploring technologies such as:
  - Automation (Ansible / n8n)
  - Docker Container Orchestration (Nomad/Kubernetes)
  - Infrastructure Orchestration (Terraform)
  - Pipelines (Jenkins)
  - Cloud Services (AWS/OCI)
  
  Technical skills are not the only area I have developed through my experience. My peers describe me as a valuable team member, who knows how to work under strict deadlines and still provide quality results.
